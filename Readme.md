Terraform Multi-Environment AWS Infrastructure (development, staging, production)

Designed and implemented a multi-environment (Dev, Staging, Prod) AWS infrastructure using Terraform for consistent and isolated deployments.
Developed Terraform modules to efficiently provision and manage EC2 instances, S3 buckets, and DynamoDB tables.
Configured a remote backend with S3 bucket for centralized state management and DynamoDB for state locking to prevent concurrency issues.
